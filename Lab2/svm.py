Support Vector Machines: 
Run SVM to train a classi
er, using radial basis as kernel function. 
Apply cross-validation to evaluate different combinations of values of the model hyper-parameters 
(box constraint C and kernel parameter Y). 
How sensitive is the cross-validation error to changes in C and Y? 
Choose the combination of C and Y that minimizes the cross-validation error, 
train the SVM on the entire dataset and report the total classi
cation error.
Advice: use a logaritmic range
